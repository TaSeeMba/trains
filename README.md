# trains
The purpose of this problem is to help the railroad provide its customers with information about the routes between towns. This is a directed graph problem.  

## Contents
A C# console application and unit tests for the application. Refer to the project level readme file for input rules. 

## ToDo
- Improve the the console application to make it more user interactive (this is current WIP).
- Accept graph nodes that are multi-character. Currently, nodes can only be alphabetic characters.
- Robust error checking for invalid input
